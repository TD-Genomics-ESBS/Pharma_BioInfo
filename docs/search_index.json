Why are there several sequences in RefSeq? In Genbank? Look at the sequence KT152889. Quickly position the annotated elements for the gene on a diagram. What is the position of the variation on the sequence? What does it correspond to (type, codon)? Among the features, the sequence source provides a cross-reference to the NCBI Taxonomy bank. Follow this link. 2.1.2 Taxonomy database What human sub-species are listed in the Taxonomy database? How many genomes are available in the Genome database for Animals, Fungi, Plants (Viridiplantae) and Eukaryotes? Please comment. To which bank does the sequence NC_045512 belong according to the access number? 2.1.3 Sequence retrieval with an access number Return on NCBI website and search the nucleic sequence NC_045512. For that, select Nucleotide on the NCBI website and search for the sequence with the access number NC_045512. What is it about? How long is the genome? Look at the field Comment. To which bank does the sequence NC_045512 belong? Is it a reliable entry? What sequencing technology was used? What can you say about this entry compared to the original GenBank entry (1st SARS-Cov-2 genome sequence)? Look for the coding region corresponding to the N protein (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein). What do you think about the composition of this protein? What problem might such a sequence pose in a similarity search? Display the genome sequence in fasta format. What are the characteristics of this format compared to the RefSeq format?

In Swissprot? Search for the human myotubularin-related protein 3. Compare the obtained entries. Which is better to use? 2.2.2 Example of a SwissProt entry: MUC1_HUMAN Are we sure of the existence of this protein (see Protein existence at the top of the page)? Compare the current format, the text format and the fasta format (see Download). How is this protein involved in breast cancer? How many isoforms are reported for this protein (see Sequences)? Align isoforms and see their differences. 2.2.3 Function – GO annotations The GO ontology allows to describe proteins according to 3 aspects. Which ones? Follow the link of GO entry GO:0004438. What is it (name, description)? What type of GO does it belong to? How often is it used to describe proteins? Are there any synonyms for this GO term? 2.2.4 Structure What can you say about the structures obtained experimentally for the protein? What can you say about the reliability of the AlphaFold prediction for this protein? 2.2.5 External links tab (top of the page) 2.2.5.1 Sequence databases Why are there many more links to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ than to RefSeq? 2.2.5.2 Families and domains in INTERPRO database Display the graphical view (View protein in InterPro). How many distinct domains are identified in this protein? Domain: IPR000082 SEA domain. From which banks are the 3 signatures associated with this InterPro entry? Follow the link to the PFAM signature. Display the signature. What is the most conserved amino acid in this domain? Search the Q13615 entry (Myotubularin-related protein 3) and find the active site : IPR016130 Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases active site. Have a look at the ProSite signature associated to this site. What is the main problem of the motif?
